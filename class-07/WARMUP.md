# Initialize LinkedList with a List

Wouldn't it be dreamy to pass in a list (aka array) to the LinkedList initializer to keep things tidy?


`new_linked_list = LinkedList(["apples","bananas","cucumbers"]) would end up with LinkedList like { apples } -> { bananas } -> { cucumbers } -> NULL`

How would you do it?
